    <p>Easy Fried Rice Recipe</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cooked,chilled rice:</strong> Any kind of white or brown rice will do. Just be sure that it is cooked (I always cook mine in this rice cooker, which works like a charm) and thoroughly chilled (in a sealed container in the refrigerator) before adding it to your hot skillet. Again, freshly-cooked rice will not work well in this recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Which add great flavor, texture and protein.</stron></li>
        <li><strong>Carrots, onions, green onions and peas:</strong>This is the base mix of veggies that I always use for fried rice, but feel free to add in other stir-fry veggies you love (see ideas below).</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> Freshly-minced.</li>
        <li><strong>Soy sauce:</strong> I created this recipe using low-sodium soy sauce. So add less if you’re using traditional soy sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Oyster sauce:</strong> This is a major flavor booster in fried rice and (don’t worry) doesn’t taste like oysters. You can find it in the Asian section of grocery stores</li>
        <li><strong>Toasted sesame oil:</strong>he finishing touch in this recipe, which is a must. You can also find it in the Asian section of grocery stores</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong>My Favorite way to stir rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Scramble your eggs:</strong>Using a small pat of butter, scramble some eggs in a large sauté pan, breaking them into small pieces as you go. Then transfer the eggs to a separate plate, and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté your veggies and garlic:</strong> Return your sauté pan to the heat, and sauté the onions, carrots, peas and garlic until soft and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir fry rice:</strong>Then turn the burner to high heat. Scooch the veggies over to one side of the pan, melt the remaining butter in the other half, and add the chilled rice, soy sauce, and oyster sauce (if using). Then stir to combine with the veggies and continue sautéing the rice, stirring every 15-20 seconds or so for 3 minutes, or until you notice the rice and veggies starting to brown slightly.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Remove pan from the heat:</strong> And stir in your green onions, sesame oil, and scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste and season:</strong> Give the rice a taste, and season with salt and pepper, plus any extra soy sauce or sesame oil if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve!</strong>Then dish it up and serve nice and warm!</li>
    </ol>
